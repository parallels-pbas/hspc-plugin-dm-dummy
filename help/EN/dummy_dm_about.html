<blockquote>
<p>The Dummy domain plug-in is designed to facilitate manual domain registration process and/or domain registration procedures testing.
<p>You can set up the Dummy domain registration plug-in to be responsible for particular top level domains (TLDs) which require manual registration, so that your customers will order such domains and you then will register these domains manually and after this mark these domains as 'registered' in the Parallels Business Automation - Standard.
